      <h2>Who was Nevie Sticks?</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">The first records mentioning Ms. Sticks date all the way back to 16th century. However back then, she was referred to mostly as <em>"the woman in gold"</em> or <em>"gold dust woman"</em>. The nickname comes from tales of folklore where Ms. Sticks would cover the ground around town in golden dust, announcing her arrival.</p>
      
      <p class="paragraph">Children would collect the golden dust, selling it to merchants and adventurers passing through town. It is highly likely Ms. Nicks sprinkled the golden dust on purpose, due to of her love for children, since the dust would crumble if held by an adult.</p>
      
      <p class="paragraph">Usually staying in a town for a few days, Ms. Sticks would spend her time taking care of, helping, and playing with the children. However, when Ms. Sticks decided to leave town, she would usually take a young girl with her, never to be seen again.</p>
      
      <p class="paragraph">No one ever saw Ms. Sticks leaving town or taking a girl, no matter how long people waited, or even locked the girls in their rooms. Ms. Sticks simply dissapeared one night without a trace. People would listen to Ms. Sticks talking to herself in her room late at night, speculating on madness, hysteria or some invisble entity.</p>     
      
      <p class="paragraph">However most people interpreted her arrival as a blessing of good luck, willing to make the "sacrifice" of a child. Most tales tell of Ms. Sticks bringing rains and storms, which were a welcome agricultural boost for the populace.</p> 
      
      <p class="paragraph">That being the case, there was still a great deal of speculation regarding the whereabouts of her victims, with the most common being the belief she formed a witches coven with the stolen girls. Some more sinister guesswork inclues her sacrificing the child to her pagan gods.</p> 

      <p class="paragraph"> Nobody has a definitive answer on "what" Ms. Sticks actually was - some called her a witch, a devil, while others worshipped her - and throught the centuries, she has earned herself a myriad of titles. She was an interesting and mysterious figure, bringer of luck, rain and gold. But always for a price.</p>
    
      <p id="end-quote">"<em>"Run run run from the gold dust woman,<br>
      storm are on their way.<br>
      hide in your room and hold tight your cushion,<br>
      before she drags you away".</em>
